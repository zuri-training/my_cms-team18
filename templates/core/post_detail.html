        Motivation isn't something that just comes to you. It"s a learned
        habit that can sometimes be difficult to achieve. Whether you want to
        improve your productivity, start that new art project, or even create
        a website, maintaining motivation is a valuable skill in all areas of
        life. So what can you turn to if you're stuck in a rut and could
        benefit from a boost? Motivational podcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Podcasts are not only free and easily accessible, but they"re also
        genuinely uplifting and inspiring. They can remind us that we're all
        human. For sure, doubts, issues and crises will inevitably come, but
        we have the power to turn them into opportunities. And sometimes, we
        only need this perspective, along with some practical tips, to make us
        feel better and move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this sound like something you'd be interested in checking out? If
        so, we've hand-picked some of the best motivational podcasts just for
        you:

        <p>01. The GaryVee Audio Experience</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gary Vaynerchuk (a.k.a. Gary Vee) has a voice that everyone needs to
        hear at least once - beyond the fact that he"s intimidatingly
        successful. His podcast not only provides valuable marketing tips for
        your business, but can also help you find empowerment in your daily
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origins of his motivational podcasts are rooted in Gary Vee"s
        personal story. Born in Belarus, he moved with his family to the U.S.
        when he was just three years old. His parents ran a discount liquor
        store, which he took over when he graduated college. From there, he
        completely rebranded the store to focus on wine, and turned a $3
        million per year business into a $60 million per year one. This was
        just the beginning of his route to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Gary Vee is primarily known for VaynerMedia, a social media
        agency. As such, you can imagine that his social channels are filled
        to the brim with fresh content that he produces every day. He also
        started a podcast, The GaryVee Audio Experience, which releases
        episodes almost on a daily basis. The tone is very “go get 'em," which
        is helpful when you need an extra push.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell: GaryVee's high energy and matter-of-factness may
        sometimes be hard to handle, but only because you need to hear it.

        <p>02. Tony Robbins Podcast</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Tony Robbins needs absolutely no introduction. His very own website
        details his experience as “an entrepreneur, #1 NY Times bestselling
        author, philanthropist, and the nation's #1 life and business
        strategist.” While that's all very impressive, it's almost too modest.
        Tony Robbins is a legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        His name has been synonymous with the term “motivational speaker” for
        decades, and he inspires listeners without full-on preaching to them.
        The podcast tackles subjects like finance, happiness, how to become an
        entrepreneur, and many others - all while providing a perspective that
        you can only get from the man himself. It allows you to get the same
        wealth of knowledge found within his books, but in a more relaxed and
        easily digestible format.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell: Robbins' natural talent for speaking makes his
        inspirational podcasts straightforward and easy to understand.
